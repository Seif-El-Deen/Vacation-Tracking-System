# Vacation Tracking System
## Vision
An application to facilitate the process of management of the vacations in the organizations between the different members like (employees, managers &amp; Human recourses).

## Functional
- Implements a flexible rules-based system for validating and verifying leave time requests. This system replaces the manual checks previously done by the HR department.
- Enables manager approval (optional) for leave requests.
- Provides access to requests for the previous calendar year.
- Allows requests to be made up to a year and a half in the future.
- Uses e-mail notification to request manager approval and notify employees of request status changes.
- Keeps activity logs for all transactions.
- Enables HR and system administration personnel to override all actions restricted by rules, with logging of those overrides.
- Allows managers to directly award personal leave time (comp time), subject to system-set limits.
- Provides a Web service interface for other internal systems to query any given employeeâ€™s vacation request summary.
- Interfaces with the HR department legacy systems to retrieve required employee information and changes.

## Non Functional Requirements
- Usability and Ease of Use
- Performance
- Security
- Compatibility and Environment Constraints
- Scalability
- Maintainability and Manageability (specifically for HR and Admin).
